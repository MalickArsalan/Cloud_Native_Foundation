# Solution: The CI Fundamentals

GitHub has a rich library of upstream actions that can be easily integrated with any repository. The suite includes a [Build and Push Docker images](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images) action which uses 3 main components:

* **login** - to logging into DockerHub
* **setup-buildx** - to use an extended Docker CLI build capabilities
* **setup-qemu** - to enable the execution of different multi-architecture containers

The following snippet showcases the Docker build and push of the application, under `.github/workflows/docker-build.yaml` file:

``` yaml

# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Docker Build and Push

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      -
        name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      -
        name: Set up QEMU
        uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v1
      -
        name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
      -
        name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1 
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
      -
        name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          file: ./Dockerfile
          platforms: linux/amd64
          push: true
          tags: {{ YOUR_DOCKERHUB_REPOSITORY }}/python-helloworld:latest
```

The Docker build and push workflow can be found in [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/solutions/github-actions/docker-build.yml). Make sure to move this file to `.github/workflows/docker-build.yaml` location to execute it.
