# Exercise: The CD Fundamentals

Continuous Delivery (CD) is the ability to get code changes reliably to production environments. This practice should be automated and should enable developers to provide value to consumers efficiently.

In this exercise, you will use ArgoCD to automate the delivery of an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

Environment Setup
Prepare the environment to create your delivery pipeline.

**_Note:_** Make sure to have [VirtualBox installed](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

- [x] Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on your machine
- [x] Examine the Vagrantfile in the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/exercises/Vagrantfile)
- [x] Create a vagrant box by using `vagrant up` command (Note: you need to be in the same repository as the Vagrantfile for this command to work)
- [x] SSH into the vagrant box by using `vagrant ssh` command
- [x] Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
- [x] Examine you cluster using `kubectl` command (Note: you need to be root to be root to access the kubeconfig file, use `sudo su -` before using kubectl command)

## Exercise

Now that you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running, let's deploy your first application using ArgoCD.

**The CD fundamentals**
Install ArgoCD and deploy your first application

- [x] Install ArgoCd by referring to the [installation guide](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/)
- [x] Expose the `argocd-server` using a `NodePort` service on port `30007` on HTTP and `30008` on HTTPS. The YAML manifest for NodePort service can be found in the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/solutions/argocd/argocd-server-nodeport.yaml)
- [x] Access the ArgoCd UI by going to `https://192.168.50.4:30008` or, `https://192.168.50.4:30007` pass the warning and reach the Log-in page
- [x] Insert login credentials, by using [credentials guide](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli)
- [x] Create an ArgoCD application named `nginx-alpine` and use the manifest provide in the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/exercises/manifests)
