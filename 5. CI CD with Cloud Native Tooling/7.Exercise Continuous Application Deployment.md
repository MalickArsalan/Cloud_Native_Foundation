# Exercise: Continuous Application Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) implies the integration of code into a shared repository, where at each push to the main branch, the code is built and tested. Frequently, the result of CI represents an artifact or a Docker image.

In this exercise, you will use GitHub Actions to automate the packaging of an application. This is a quite challenging exercise because you are provided with all the necessary documents and you will explore some of the actions on your own.

Being able to explore documents and tackle tasks independently is important. Take this opportunity and have fun! However, if you do need some help, feel free to check out the video on the solution page.

**Environment Setup**
Prepare the GitHub repository and application to test GitHub actions:

- [x] Create a new GitHub repository with name python-helloworld
- [x] Copy the `python-helloworld` application from the [course repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/solutions/python-helloworld)
- [x] Create the repository to store the GitHub Actions using `mkdir -p /.github/workflows` command

**Exercise:**

Create a new GitHub Actions in the `/.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` that will build and push the Docker image for a [Python web application](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/exercises/python-helloworld), with the following requirements:

- Image name: `python-helloworld`
- Tag: `latest`
- Platforms: `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64`

GitHub marketplace has a rich suite of upstream actions that can be easily integrated within a repository. One of the upstream action is [Build and Push Docker images](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images), which can be used to implement the required CI task.

The above GitHub action uses DockerHub Tokens and encrypted GitHub secrets to login into DockerHub and to push new images. To set up these credentials refer to the following resources:

- Create [DockerHub Tokens](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-new-personal-access-tokens/)
- Create [GitHub encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets)

**Note:** you will need a **Dockerfile** to build the image.
