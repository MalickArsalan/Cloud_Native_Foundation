# ArgoCD Walkthrough

## Installation

This demo is a walkthrough of the process of installing and accessing ArgoCD.

Here are some noteworthy steps:

* Use the official ArgoCD [install](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#1-install-argo-cd) page
* The YAML manifest for the NodePort service can be found under the [argocd-server-nodeport.yaml](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/solutions/argocd/argocd-server-nodeport.yaml) file in the course repository
* Access the ArgoCD UI by going to `https://192.168.50.4:30008` or `http://192.168.50.4:30007`
* When accessing the ArgoCD UI, a browser SSL warning is encountered. This is happening because the ArgoCD server is not setup with SSL certificates to authenticate the server. Hence, an insecure connection is established with the server. As a result, the warning prompt is encountered and you should just bypass the warning page
* Login credentials can be retrieved using the steps in the [credentials guide](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli)

## Application Deployment

This demo provides a step by step guide on how to deploy an application using ArgoCD.

To follow the demo closely, use the following resources:

* [Python-manifests](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/solutions/argocd/python-manifests) folder contains the YAML configuration for the Python hello-world application
* [argocd-python](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/solutions/argocd/argocd-python.yaml) manifest for the Application CRD to used to deploy the Python hello-world application
