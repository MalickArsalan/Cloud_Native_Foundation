# Exercise: Declarative Kubernetes Manifests

Kubernetes is widely known for its imperative and declarative management techniques. In the previous exercise, you have deployed the following resources using the **imperative** approach. Now deploy them using the **declarative** approach.

* a namespace
  * name: `demo`
  * label: `tier: test`

* a deployment:
  * image: `nginx:alpine`
  * name: `nginx-apline`
  * namespace: `demo`
  * replicas: 3
  * labels: `app: nginx`, `tag: alpine`

* a service:
  * expose the above deployment on port `8111`
  * namespace: `demo`

* a configmap:
  * name: `nginx-version`
  * containing key-value pair: `version=alpine`
  * namespace: `demo`

_**Note**_: Nginx is one of the public Docker images, that you can access and use for your exercises or testing purposes.

Make sure the following tasks are completed:

* [x] Use the **declarative** approach to create a Namespace
* [x] Use the **declarative** approach to create a Deployment
* [x] Use the **declarative** approach to create a Service
* [x] Use the **declarative** approach to create a ConfigMap

## Solution: Declarative Kubernetes Manifests

### Declarative Approach

The declarative approach consists of using a full YAML definition of resources. As well, with this approach, you can perform directory level operations.

Examine the manifests for all of the resources in the [exercises/manifests](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/tree/main/exercises/manifests).

To create the resources, use the following command:

``` bash

kubectl apply -f exercises/manifests/
```

To inspect all the resources within the namespace, use the following command:

``` bash

kubectl get all -n demo

```
