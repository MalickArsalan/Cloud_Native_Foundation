# Declarative Kubernetes Manifests

Kubectl is the Kubernetes CLI, that support two different configuration management techniques:

1. Imperative
   * With imperative approach, the operations are performed on the object in the cluster
   * It is best suited for development phases
   * It presents a low level-bar to interact with the cluster.
  
2. Declarative
    * Declarative are performed on the manifest stored locally,
    * It is recommend to use it in the production systems,
    * However, this technique presents a high learning curve, as an in-depth understanding of the YAML manifest structure is required.
    * Additionally, using YAML manifests unlocks the possibility of configuring more advanced options, such as volume mounts, readiness and liveness probes, etc.

**Note:** So far all the kubectl command that you have learned are imperative approach. You have:

* Created
* Interacted
* and Manage resources directly on the live cluster.

For example:

Creating the go-helloworld deployment

``` bash

kubectl create deploy go-helloworld --image=pixelpotato/go-helloworld:v1.0.0 --replicas=3 --namespace test-udacity
```

To solve that vast configuration issue, the YAML manifest were introduced.

* The manifest encapsulate the **full configuration** for the covering these objects where we can expand the definition and the state of the resources.
* This is done by through YAML, the data serialization standard of choice by the Kubernetes community

## YAML Manifest structure

A YAML manifest consists of 4 obligatory sections:

* **apiVersion** -apiVersion represent the Kubernetes API used to create an object
* **kind** - It defines the object type to be created or configured
* **metadata** - stores data that makes the object identifiable, such as its name, namespace, and labels
* **spec** - defines the desired configuration state of the resource

To get the YAML manifest of any resource within the cluster, use the `kubectl get {{ resource }} {{ resource_name }} -o yaml`  command associated with the -o YAML flag, which represent the out put should be YAML formatted. Additionally, to explore all configurable parameters for a resource it is highly recommended to reference the official [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

**Note:** to create a deployment using a YAML manifest use the `kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml` command/. This will require the path to the YAML file with the desired configuration and it can be done by using the `0` flag.

### Deployment YAML manifest

In addition to the required sections of a YAML manifest, a Deployment resource covers the configuration of ReplicaSet, RollingOut strategy, and containers. Bellow is a full manifest of a Deployment explaining each parameter:

``` yaml

## Set the API endpoint used to create the Deployment resource.
apiVersion: apps/v1
## Define the type of the resource.
kind: Deployment
## Set the parameters that make the object identifiable, such as its name, namespace, and labels.
metadata:
  annotations:
  labels:
    app: go-helloworld
  name: go-helloworld
  namespace: default
## Define the desired configuration for the Deployment resource.
spec:
  ## Set the number of replicas.
  ## This will create a ReplicaSet that will manage 3 pods of the Go hello-world application.
  replicas: 3
  ## Identify the pods managed by this Deployment using the following selectors.
  ## In this case, all pods with the label `go-helloworld`.
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: go-helloworld
  ## Set the RollingOut strategy for the Deployment.
  ## For example, roll out only 25% of the new pods at a time.
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  ## Set the configuration for the pods.
  template:
    ## Define the identifiable metadata for the pods.
    ## For example, all pods should have the label `go-helloworld`
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-helloworld
    ## Define the desired state of the pod configuration.
    spec:
      containers:
        ## Set the image to be executed inside the container and image pull policy
        ## In this case, run the `go-helloworld` application in version v2.0.0 and
        ## only pull the image if it's not available on the current host.
      - image: pixelpotato/go-helloworld:v2.0.0
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: go-helloworld
        ## Expose the port the container is listening on.
        ## For example, exposing the application port 6112 via TCP.
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6112
          protocol: TCP
        ## Define the rules for the liveness probes.
        ## For example, verify the application on the main route `/`,
        ## on application port 6112. If the application is not responsive, then the pod will be restarted automatically. 
        livenessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 6112
        ## Define the rules for the readiness probes.
        ## For example, verify the application on the main route `/`,
        ## on application port 6112. If the application is responsive, then traffic will be sent to this pod.
        readinessProbe:
           httpGet:
             path: /
             port: 6112
        ## Set the resource requests and limits for an application.
        resources:
        ## The resource requests guarantees that the desired amount 
        ## CPU and memory is allocated for a pod. In this example, 
        ## the pod will be allocated with 64 Mebibytes and 250 miliCPUs.
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
        ## The resource limits ensure that the application is not consuming 
        ## more than the specified CPU and memory values. In this example, 
        ## the pod will not surpass 128 Mebibytes and 500 miliCPUs.
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### Service YAML manifest

In addition to the required sections of a YAML manifest, a Service resource covers the configuration of service type and ports the service should configure. Bellow is a full manifest of a Service explaining each parameter:

``` yaml

## Set the API endpoint used to create the Service resource.
apiVersion: v1
## Define the type of the resource.
kind: Service
## Set the parameters that make the object identifiable, such as its name, namespace, and labels.
metadata:
  labels:
    app: go-helloworld
  name: go-helloworld
  namespace: default
## Define the desired configuration for the Service resource.
spec:
  ## Define the ports that the service should serve on. 
  ## For example, the service is exposed on port 8111, and
  ## directs the traffic to the pods on port 6112, using TCP.
  ports:
  - port: 8111
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 6112
  ## Identify the pods managed by this Service using the following selectors.
  ## In this case, all pods with the label `go-helloworld`.
  selector:
    app: go-helloworld
  ## Define the Service type, here set to ClusterIP.
  type: ClusterIP
```

## Useful commands

Kubernetes YAML manifests can be created using the kubectl apply command, with the following syntax:

``` yaml
# create a resource defined in the YAML manifests with the name manifest.yaml
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml
```

To delete a resource using a YAML manifest, the kubectl delete command, with the following syntax:

``` yaml

# delete a resource defined in the YAML manifests with the name manifest.yaml
kubectl delete -f manifest.yaml
```

Kubernetes documentation is the best place to explore the available parameters for YAML manifests. However, a support YAML template can be constructed using kubectl commands. This is possible by using the `--dry-run=client` and `-o yaml` flags which instructs that the command should be evaluated on the client-side only and output the result in YAML format.

``` yaml

# get YAML template for a resource 
kubectl create RESOURCE [REQUIRED FLAGS] --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

For example, to get the template for a Deployment resource, we need to use the create command, pass the required parameters, and associated with the `--dry-run` and `-o yaml` flags. This outputs the base template, which can be used further for more advanced configuration.

``` yaml

# get the base YAML templated for a demo Deployment running a nxing application
kubectl create deploy demo --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

**New terms:**

* **Imperative configuration** - resource management technique, that operates and interacts directly with the live objects within the cluster.
* **Declarative configuration** - resource management technique, that operates and manages resources using YAML manifests stored locally.
