# Exercise: Docker for Application Packaging

Package a Go web application using Docker capabilities. This exercise will involve the creation of a Docker image and pushing it to a public image registry, such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Note: You will require a valid DockerHub account.

**Environment Setup:**

Set up your environment to create a Docker image for an application:

- [x] Clone the [course exercise repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1) using git
- [x] Navigate inside `exercises/go-helloworld`
- [x] Follow the `README.md` instructions to run and access the application.

Once you can access the application through the local browser, the next steps are to package the application using Docker.

## Exercise

Create the Docker image for the Go web application and push it to DockerHub, considering the following requirements:

Dockerfile:

- use the `golang:alpine` base image
- set the working directory to `/go/src/app`
- make sure to copy all the files from the current directory to the container working directory (e.g. `/go/src/app`)
- to build the application, use `go build -o helloworld` command, where `-o helloworld` will create the binary of the application with the name `helloworld`
- the application should be accessible on port `6111`
- and lastly, the command to start the container is to invoke the binary created earlier, which is `./helloworld`

 Docker image:

- should have the name go-helloworld
- should have a valid tag, and a version with a major, minor, and patch included
- should be available in DockerHub, under your username e.g. `pixelpotato/go-helloworld`

Docker container:

- should be running on your local machine, by referencing the image from the DockerHub with a valid tag e.g. `pixelpotato/go-helloworld:v5.12.3`

**Note:** You will need to use `docker login` to login into Docker before pushing images to DockerHub.

## Solution

The following snippet showcases the Dockerfile for the application:

``` docker

FROM golang:alpine

WORKDIR /go/src/app

ADD . .

RUN go build  -o helloworld

EXPOSE 6111

CMD ["./helloworld"]
```

To build tag and push the image to DockerHub, use the following commands:

``` bash

# build the image
docker build -t go-helloworld .

# tag the image
docker tag go-helloworld pixelpotato/go-helloworld:v1.0.0

# push the image
docker push pixelpotato/go-helloworld:v1.0.0
```
