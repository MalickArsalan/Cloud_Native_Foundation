# Kubeconfig

To access a Kubernetes cluster a kubeconfig file is required. A kubeconfig file has all the necessary cluster metadata and authentication details, that grants the user permission to query the cluster objects
Usually, the kubeconfig file is stored locally under the `~/.kube/config`. However, k3s places the kubeconfig file within `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` path.

**Note:**  the location of a kubeconfig file can be set through the `--kubeconfig` kubectl flag or via the `KUBECONFIG` environmental variable.

A Kubeconfig file has 3 main distinct sections:

* **Cluster** -  It encapsulates the metadata for a cluster, such as the name of the cluster, API server endpoint, and certificate authority used to check the identity of the user
* **User** - It contains the user details that want access to the cluster, including the user name, and any authentication metadata, such as username, password, token or client, and key certificates.
* **Context** -  It links a user to a cluster. If the user credentials are valid and the cluster is up, access to resources is granted. Also, a `current-context` can be specified, which instructs which context (cluster and user) should be used to query the cluster.

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1
# define the cluster metadata 
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: {{ CA }}
    server: https://127.0.0.1:63668
  name: udacity-cluster
# define the user details 
users:
# `udacity-user` user authenticates using client and key certificates 
- name: udacity-user
  user:
    client-certificate-data: {{ CERT }}
    client-key-data: {{ KEY }}
# `green-user` user authenticates using a token
- name: green-user
  user:
    token: {{ TOKEN }}
# define the contexts 
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: udacity-cluster
    user: udacity-user
  name: udacity-context
# set the current context
current-context: udacity-context
```

## Kubeconfig Walkthrough

### Clusters Commands

``` bash
# Inspect  the endpoints for the cluster and installed add-ons 
kubectl cluster-info

# List all the nodes in the cluster. 
# To get a more detailed view of the nodes, the `-o wide` flag can be passed
kubectl get nodes [-o wide] 

# Describe a cluster node.
# Typical configuration: node IP, capacity (CPU and memory), a list of running pods on the node, podCIDR, etc.
kubectl describe node {{ NODE NAME }}
```

**New terms:**

* **Kubeconfig** - a metadata file that grants a user access to a Kubernetes cluster
