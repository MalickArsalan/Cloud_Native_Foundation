# Deploy Your First Kubernetes Cluster

## Cluster Creation

To deploy Kubernetes cluster, you need to make sure that control plane and data plane are up and running. This process is referred as **bootstrapping** of a cluster.
It is possible to bootstrap a cluster manually by **distributing** and **installing** each component individually. However, this is a highly tedious task that has a higher risk of misconfiguration.

Overtime, multiple tools emerged in the ecosystem to handle the bootstrapping of a cluster automatically.

* To create a Production-grade clusters
  * [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/)
  * [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray)
  * [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
  * [K3s](https://k3s.io/)
  
These tools support the bootstrapping of a cluster using on-premise or public cloud servers.

* To create a Development-grade clusters
  * [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
  * [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

These are the tools that support the creation of cluster locally for testing and development purposes.

### K3s

K3s presents a

* **Lightweight** version of Kubernetes
* That is installed using just **one binary**
* On execution, it will create a **single node cluster** with a working control plane **ready** for deployment.
* It also install **kubectl**, the Kubernetes command line tool used to query the cluster resources.

A good introduction to k3d, written by k3d's creator Thorsten Klein, can be found [here](https://www.suse.com/c/introduction-k3d-run-k3s-docker-src/)

## Create Vagrant Box And Install Kubernetes with k3s

This demo is a step-by-step guide on how to create a vagrant box and install a Kubernetes cluster using k3s. To follow this demo, reference the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/exercises/Vagrantfile) from the course repository.

A nice introduction to Vagrant can be found in [this article](https://community.suse.com/posts/vagrant-never-gets-old)

Before following the demo:

Make sure to have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) `6.1.16` or higher installed.
You also need to install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on your machine.

``` bash
# Inspect available vagrant boxes 
vagrant status 

# create a vagrant box using the Vagrantfile in the current directory
vagrant up

# SSH into the vagrant box
# Note: this command uses the .vagrant folder to identify the details of the vagrant box
vagrant ssh
```

**New terms:**

* **Bootstrap** - the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster, by ensuring that each node has the necessary components to be fully operational
