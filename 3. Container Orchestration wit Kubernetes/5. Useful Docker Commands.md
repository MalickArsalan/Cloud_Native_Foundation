# Useful Docker Commands

Docker provides a rich set of actions that can be used to build, run, tag, and push images. Below is a list of handy Docker commands used in practice.

***Note:*** In the following commands the following arguments are used:

* OPTIONS - define extra configuration through flags
* IMAGE - sets the name of the image
* NAME- set the name of the image
* COMMAND and ARG - instruct the container to run specific commands associated with a set of arguments

**Build Images**:
To build an image, use the following command, where PATH sets the location of the Dockerfile and referenced application files:

``` Docker
  docker build [OPTIONS] PATH
```

**Run Images**:
To run an image, use the following command:

``` Docker
  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

```

**List Containers**:
To list all running containers, use the following command:

``` Docker

**Tag Images**:
To tag an image, use the following command, where SOURCE_IMAGE defines the name of an image on the current machine and TARGET_IMAGE defines the repository, name, and version of an image:

``` Docker
  docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
```

**Login to DockerHub**:
To login into DockerHub, use the following command:

``` Docker
  docker login
```

**Push Images**:
To push an image to DockerHub, use the following command:
