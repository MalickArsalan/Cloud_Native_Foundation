# Deploy Your First Kubernetes Cluster

So far, we have learned that Kubernetes is a mechanism to manage containers at scale and that there are more than 160+ certified providers to bootstrap a cluster.

Now it's time for you to deploy your first Kubernetes cluster.

This exercise will focus on provisioning a vagrant box and installing a Kubernetes cluster using k3s.

## Environment Setup

Provision a Vagrant box locally and install Kubernetes with k3s.

Note: Make sure to have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 6.1.16 or higher installed .

- [ ] Install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on your machine
- [ ] Clone the [repository](https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1) using git commands
- [ ] Navigate inside the `exercises` directory and examine the `VagrantFile`
- [ ] Create a vagrant box by using `vagrant up` command (**Note:** you need to be in the same repository as the Vagrantfile for this command to work)
- [ ] SSH into the vagrant box by using `vagrant ssh` command
- [ ] Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)
- [ ] Examine your cluster using `kubectl` command (**Note:** you need to be root to access the kubeconfig file, use `sudo su -` before using kubectl commands)

### Exercise

Now you should have a Kubernetes cluster up and running. Examine the cluster and identity of the following details.

- **Reflect**
From the kubeconfig, identify:

  - the IP and port of the API server
  - authentication mechanism

  **Note**: Refer to the main [k3s installation guide](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/quick-start/#install-script), to find the location of the kubeconfig file.

- **Reflect**
From the cluster using kubectl commands to identify:

  - endpoints of the control plane and add-ons
  - amount of nodes
  - node internal IP
  - the pod CIDR allocate to the node

  **Note:** To access kubectl commands you need to become root by using `sudo su -` command.
