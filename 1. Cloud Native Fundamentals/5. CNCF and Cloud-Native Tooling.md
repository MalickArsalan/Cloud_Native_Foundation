# CNCF and Cloud-Native Tooling

## Container Orchestrator

With the pairs of containers, it was imperative to introduce a tool that would managed containers at scale. Such As

* Docker Swarm
* Apache Mesos
* Kubernetes took the lead in defining how containerized workloads should be **deployed,** **managed** and **configured**.

Kubernetes derives from **Borg**, a *Google* open-source  software that **orchestrator container**. Kubernetes is part of **CNCF** **or Cloud Native Computing Foundation**.


## Kubernetes

Kubernetes automates the:

* Configuration
* Management
* Scalability

Overall, Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that is capable to solutionize the integration of the following functionalities:

* Runtime:          For application execution environment
* Networking:       For application connectivity
* Storage:          For application resources
* Service Mesh:     For granular control of traffic within a cluster
* Logs and metrics: To construct the observability stack
* Tracing:          For building the full request journey and many more

## CNCF - Cloud Native Computing Foundation

A large part of these tools are maintained under **CNCF** umbrella.
CNCF provides a **vendor-neutral home** to **open-source projects**:

* Kubernetes
* Prometheus
* ETCD
* Envoy etc.
