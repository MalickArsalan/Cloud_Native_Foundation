# Monoliths and MicroServices

Once we collected and analyzed the application requirements and available resources, we can move to **design** phase.
In this phase we will choose the most suitable **Application Architecture**.

==We will cover how a simple booking application can be designed using both **Monoliths** and **MicroServices** based models.==

## Application Architecture

In most of the cases 2 distinct models are referenced: monoliths and micro services.

Regardless of the adopted structure, the main goal is to design an application that delivers value to customers and can be easily adjusted to accommodate new functionalities

### Application Tiers

At a macro level, an application is composed of three main tiers or an architecture encapsulates the 3 main tiers of an application:

* **UI** (User Interface) - handles HTTP requests from the users and returns a response
* **Business logic** - represents a collection of functionalities that provides a service to the customer.
* **Data layer** - implements access and storage of data objects through our application execution, buy using database
