# Monoliths and MicroServices

Once we collected and analyzed the application requirements and available resources, we can move to **design** phase.
In this phase we will choose the most suitable **Application Architecture**.

==We will cover how a simple booking application can be designed using both **Monoliths** and **MicroServices** based models.==

## Application Architecture

In most of the cases 2 distinct models are referenced: monoliths and micro services.

![Architecture Models](3.1.MonolithsAndMicroservices.png)

Regardless of the adopted structure, the main goal is to design an application that delivers value to customers and can be easily adjusted to accommodate new functionalities

 **Application Tiers**:

At a macro level, an application is composed of three main tiers or an architecture encapsulates the 3 main tiers of an application:

* **UI** (User Interface) - handles HTTP requests from the users and returns a response
* **Business logic** - represents a collection of functionalities that provides a service to the customer.
* **Data layer** - implements access and storage of data objects through our application execution, buy using database

### Monoliths

In a monolithic architecture, application tiers can be described as:

* part of the same units
* all business logic functions are:
  * managed in a single repository
  * sharing same resources (e.g. CPU and memory)
  * developed in one programming language
* The **packaging,** **distribution** and  **deployment** of a monolith application are  represented by a single artifact or binary, which will include the code for entire  **stack**.

**E.g**: Imagine we are developing a booking application using a monolithic approach.

* In this case, the UI is the website that the user interacts with.
* The business logic contains the code that provides the booking functionalities, such as search, booking, payment, and so on. This functions are managed together in:
  * Single repository.
  * Using one programming language (e.g. Java or Go) 
* The data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer data.

**Note**: All of these components are managed as a unit, and the release is done using a single binary.

### MicroServices

The MicroServices approach aims to breakdown the application into:

* **smaller,** **independent** units.
* Each functionality represents a separate service containing
  * Its **Logic** and its own allocated **resources** (e.g. CPU and memory)
  * Each service exposes well-defined **API** (Application Programming Interface) for *interaction* and *communication* with other available units
  * Every unit is implemented using the **programming language** of choice. This enables concurrent development cycles as multiple team can work on building multiple services at the same time
  * Each service is composed of a separate repository with its own **binary** that contains the code and the dependencies for that unit alone.

**E.g**: Imagine we are developing a booking application using a **micro Services** approach.

* In this case, the UI remains the website that the user interacts with
* Business logic is decomposed of many independents units
  * login
  * payment
  * confirmation
  * and many more....
* Each services is written in its own programming language (e.g. Go for the payment service and Python for login service).
* To interact with other services, each unit exposes an API.
* And lastly, the data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer and order data.
**Note:** As expected, each unit has its own repository and it will be deployed using its own binary.

## Architecture Consideration

Choosing an architecture for an application is highly impacted by the functional requirements and available resources.

**Functional Requirements:**

* Product features
* Stake holders
* Dependencies

**Available Resources:**

* Engineering Teams
* Time Frames
* Finances
* Internal Knowledge o a Programming Language or Tool

**New Terms**:

* **Monolith:** application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit
  
* **MicroService:** application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units
