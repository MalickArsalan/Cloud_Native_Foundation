# Best Practices For Application Deployment

We will go thorough the best practices to use when developing an application that aims to be containerized.

## Best Practices

These practices are focused on health checks, metrics, logs, tracing, and resource consumption.
The purposes of these practices is to increase visibility and improve consumption for a service.

### Health Checks

* Health checks are implemented to showcase the **status** of an application.
* Usually, health checks are represented by an HTTP endpoint such as `/healthz` or `/status`
* These endpoints return an HTTP **response** showcasing if the application is
  * `result: "healthy"`
  * `result: "error"`

### Metrics

Metrics are necessary to understand the behavior of an application.  

* Statistics should be gathered for individual services as it will increase the visibility of what resources tha application requires to be fully operational, For Example:
  * Amount of CPU
  * Amount of memory used
  * Network Throughput.
* A servic can report in

### Logs

* **DEBUG** -
* **INFO** -
* **WARN** -
* **ERROR** -
* **FATAL** -
