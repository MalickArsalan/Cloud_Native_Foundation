# Summary

In this lesson, we have covered how to build an application using monolith and micro service-based architecture. The choice of an application structure is highly impacted by available resources, requirements, and involved trade-offs. But more importantly, we have covered development practices that should be considered to optimize an application's resilience, time to recovery, and traceability.

Overall, in this lesson, we covered:

* Monoliths and Micro Services
* Trade-offs for Monoliths and Micro Services
* Practices for Application Development

**Glossary:**

* **Monolith:** application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit
* **Micro Service:** application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units
