# Lesson Conclusion

Throughout its evolution, an organization needs to periodically evaluate available cloud-computing services, to ensure that the business requirements are always fulfilled. The industry has an abundance of cloud-computing offerings, such as on-premise, IaaS, PaaS, and FaaS, with a rich collection of open-source and vendor managed tools. In this lesson, we analyzed Cloud Foundry, an open-source PaaS, that can be hosted on any available compute and provide a unified and powerful end-user experience. We have also explored, FaaS an event-driven offering, that increases the cost-efficiency of a platform.

Overall, throughout this lesson we explored:

* PaaS Mechanisms
* Cloud Foundry
* Function as a Service

**Glossary:**

* **On-premise** - cloud-computing service, where a team owns the entire technology stack.
* **IaaS** or **Infrastructure as a Service** - cloud-computing service that offers the abstraction of networking, storage, server, and virtualization layers.
* **PaaS** or **Platform as a Service** - cloud-computing service, where the infrastructure components are managed fully by a 3rd party provider, and a team manages only the application and the data associated with it.
* **Cloud Foundry** - an open-source PaaS offering, that can be hosted on any available infrastructure
* **FaaS** or **Function as a Service** - event-driven cloud-computing service that requires only the application code to execute successfully.
