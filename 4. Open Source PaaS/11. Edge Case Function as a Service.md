# Edge Case: Function as a Service

Using the PaaS solution implies that there will always be at least one replica of the application up and running at all times.
This is great if the product is used by consumer 24/7.

However, there are use cases where customers interact with a service only **once a day** or **for a couple of hours within a day**. For example, a service to update a timetable with the new bus schedule once a day. In this case, using a PaaS offering has one major downside: it is **not cost-efficient**. For example, with Cloud Foundry there will always be an instance of the application up and running, even if the service is used once a day. However, the team is billed for a full day.

or this scenario, a **FaaS** or **Function as a Service** is a more suitable offering. FaaS is an **event-driven** cloud-computing service that allows the execution of code **without any management of the infrastructure** and configuration files. As a result, the timetable update service is invoked only once a day, and for the rest of the time, there are no replicas of this service. A team will be billed only for the time the service is executed.

Throughout the release process, a FaaS solution only requires the application code that is built and executed immediately. In comparison with a PaaS offering, this FaaS has a quicker usability rate, as no data management or configuration files are necessary.

Popular FaaS solutions are AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloud Functions from GCP, and many more.
