# Cloud Foundry

There are dozens of pass offerings from cloud providers. Most of these offerings are tied to existing services and resources of the provider.
For example, using app engine from GCP or Google Cloud Platform narrows the application catalog to GCP services only

* In contrast, Cloud Foundry is an **open-source PaaS**, as a standalone software package that can be deployed on top of any existing cloud providers or on premises.
* Due to open-source nature there is **no vendor lock-in** and the community can contribute to its future releases.
* As expected, Cloud Foundry is built to **handle the application lifecycle** stages such as build, deployment, execution, scalability from the initial stages with a team's choice of the programming language framework

_**Note:**_ some offerings of Cloud Foundry, can be deployed on top of Kubernetes, meaning that its main components are running as pods within a cluster.

Cloud Foundry consists of multiple components that provide these core capabilities:

* **Routing** - handle the incoming external traffic and route it to applications managed by cloud foundry.
* **Authentication** - identity management to user accounts
* **Application lifecycle** - controls the application deployments, monitors their status, and reconciles any new changes to reach the desired state of the application.
* **Application storage and execution** - handle the availability of artifacts to applications managed by Cloud Foundry
* **Service** - use service brokers to provisions on-demand the dependency services for an application, such as a database or third-party APIs
* **Messaging** - ensure the communication between Cloud Foundry components
* **Metrics and logging** - aggregates the system and application metrics and logs to developers

In the following sections, we will explore Cloud Foundry using [SUSE Cloud Application Platform Developer Sandbox](https://developer.suse.com/capsandbox/). However, you can explore Cloud Foundry's functionalities using the following offerings as well:

* [IBM Cloud Foundry](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-foundry)
* [SAP Cloud Platform](https://www.sap.com/products/application-development-integration.html)
* [Anynines](https://paas.anynines.com/)

## Could Foundry Walkthrough - Part 1

Let's explore the release of an application using Cloud Foundry!

**Note:** The walkthrough demos aim to highlight the simplified developer experience to release an application without the need to manage infrastructure components. Learning and understanding each Cloud Foundry functionality and implementation details is _**not**_ an objective for this course.

This demo showcases the main capabilities of the Stratos console and Cloud Foundry.

Some of the noteworthy sections are:

* Marketplace and Services - research the service catalog and explore any integrated services
* Organizations - used to manage multi-tenancy, quotas, and access to applications
* Routes - list all available endpoints used to access deployed applications
* Build Packs - explore available buildpacks packages used to build an application
* Security groups - configure the endpoints that the application can communicate with
