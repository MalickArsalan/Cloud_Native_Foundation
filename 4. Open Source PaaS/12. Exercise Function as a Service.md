# Exercise: Function as a Service

FaaS (Function as a service) unlocks the ability to solely focus on building an application with no concerns for the underlying infrastructure. However, it is crucial to comprehend its usage within a microservice-based design.

Imagine the following scenario: you are working for a media (newspaper) company and was assigned to develop a microservice responsible for the life-cycle of customer accounts. The principal operations include account creation and deletion.

Considering the above, reflect on what mechanisms you would choose to deploy the microservice, PaaS, or FaaS. Elaborate on your reasoning.

**Solution for a microservice:**
What mechanism would you choose to deploy the customer account management microservice? Explain your reasoning.

**Ans:**

In most cases, in a newspaper context, the readers are more focused on the news content rather than managing their accounts. Also, the number of requests to get an article can be a thousand fold higher than the number of requests to create or delete an account. As such, you can assume that the microservice should not be running at all times consuming available resources, and instead invoke it on demand-only.

Conclusively, a FaaS solution would be more suitable for the management of customer account microservice.
