1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
For a newspaper, the readers are more focused on

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,180
the news content rather than managing their accounts.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,249
As such, we can assume that handling requests to deliver the content have priority

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:16,990
and that the account management is a secondary service that should be invoked on demand.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,540
With a past solution,

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,255
we will have at least one replica of the application up and running at all time.

7
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:27,390
This is not cost-efficient.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,480
FSL Frank suits this case better as the service will be invoked on demand only.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,640
As a result, this is a more suitable solution as it's more cost-effective.
